1. Set up GitHub and copy Arcticraft to your local system. (Download link: http://windows.github.com/)
2. Set up MCP anywhere , install Forge and MainMenuAPI, (or get your existing setup, however you may NOT overwrite the Arcticraft sources. You must allow merging folders!!!), and copy it into the inner Arcticraft folder. This should be your setup now:
   (To access the GitHub folder, click on "tools" and then on "open in explorer" in GitHub)

->GitHub
  ->Arcticraft
    ->Arcticraft
      ->bin
      ->conf
      ->docs
      ->eclipse
      ->... (MCP here) it's not as complicated as you may think. let me show you sth
    ->.gitignore

3. You also have to change the project path of Eclipse. By default it is C:\Users\<yourname>\Documents\GitHub\Arcticraft\Arcticraft\eclipse
4. When you are coding, don't close GitHub.
5. When you would like to check for code changes, press F5 in GitHub, and if the sync text is visible, click it. After it's done, go back into Eclipse, which auto-updates the changes nomally.
6. When you made a change to the code, save everything in Eclipse, press the F5 key in GitHub, enter a commit title, and press on commit change. Then click the sync text. 

NOTE: Ask Ben to add you to the Arcticraft repo!
